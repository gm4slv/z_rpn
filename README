a new project building on the z_math complex number experiment

this adds a stack and basic RPN-style functionality

I'm using this as a learning device for working with
structs and pointers and memory management.

It's a steep learning curve!

Features so far:
================

stack : enter real & imaginary (rect)
stack : enter magnitude & angle (polar)

each number on the stack can be in polar or rect. without forcing all
stack level to follow the same format.

stack: roll-down
stack: swap x<>y
stack : clear x 

last x : stored after a calculation
last x : can be retrieved to stack

calculation between two rect. format numbers -> result in rect.
calculation between two polar format numbersr -> result in polar
calculation between one polar and one rect. format number -> result in polar.

stack and last x :  states are saved at exit and restored at start

arithmetical functions:
------------------------

add
subtract
multiply
divide

invert
complex conjugate

rect->polar
polar->rect

unit vector

dot product
cross product
